h1. Watchman

Watchman is a simple solution for doing Authentication and Authorization. This plugin is far from complete however it has the features below.

h2. Simple API for declaring roles

Watchman believes that roles belong to models and so it lets you declare roles and permissions in the model.

@class Document < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_roles :owner, :collaborator
  permit :owner, :to => [:edit, :delete, :share]
  permit :collaborator, :to => [:share]
end@

The plugin includes an @assign@ method in every model.

@document=Document.new(params[:document])
document.assign :role, :to=>current_user@

These roles and permissions can then be used in the controller and various other parts of your rails app. Watchman provides the following convenience methods on the User class included in the plugin.

@User.in_role? :owner, Document.find(:first)
#checks if the user has role for the document instance
#it takes the logged in user as default from the UserSession object
#this searches both the groups and users associated with the role

user.can? :collaborate, @

h2. TODO

- We badly need generators for the default schema. That is coming really soon.
- Optimize the query for a bazillion users. Get rid of loops.
